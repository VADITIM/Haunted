This game was developed as part of a first-year exam project, conducted between 19.08.24 and 08.10.24.
Designed and published by STUD10S.

Developed using Unity with C#, the project brought together a team of three developers, three 3D designers, and four cross-media designers.

The game blends creativity, technology, and teamwork, featuring an Escape Room designed genre inspired by Superliminal, based on the Heidelberger Castle to teach various aspects of it and the seven stages of grief.


Haunted's game design was tailored around the seven stages of grief.
Each room differs in its puzzles by their corresponding items, representing their room and unique design.
